## P ── Why Revisit "Consciousness" Again?

### Five Driving Forces

1. **🔬 Technological Momentum**
   The convergence of BCI, Neuropixels, and generative AI enables previously philosophical propositions to be validated at signal and code levels.
2. **🏥 Clinical Demands**
   Long COVID brain fog, deep coma assessment, DBS/CLS modulation urgently require quantifiable "consciousness scales" to replace sole reliance on behavioral observation.
3. **⚠️ Social Risks**
   Generative AI, synthetic biology, and panopticon surveillance push "whether machines possess/should possess consciousness" to the public policy level.
4. **🧩 Theoretical Fragmentation**
   Free energy, IIT, GNW, critical brain theories and research exist at the frontier; we hope to open possibilities for mutual resonance and integration.
5. **🌐 Open Science Era**
   GitHub, OpenNeuro, OSF make crowdsourced reanalysis a viable pathway.

## F ── Overview of Major Theoretical Clusters

### Four Major Theoretical Axes

1. **Predictive Coding & Free Energy**
2. **Critical Synchronization & Self-Organized Criticality** (SOC)
3. **Geometric Topology & Integrated Information** (TDA & IIT)
4. **Energy-Metabolism & Information Efficiency** (Energetics & η)

> 💡 **Insight**: The above four clusters each excel in their domains; we discovered their mutual influences during exploration.

#### Detailed Analysis of Four Theoretical Clusters

1. **Predictive Coding & Free Energy**
   **Core**: The brain aims to minimize free energy *F* of sensory prediction errors as an objective function.
   **Representatives**: Friston (2010); bidirectional Bayesian inference between high-low levels.
   **Strengths**: Connects perception, motor, and learning under unified principles; mappable to brain regional hierarchies.
   **Limitations**: Difficult to correspond to sudden ignition of "reportable consciousness"; free energy challenging to quantify in vivo.

2. **Critical Synchronization & SOC** (Critical Brain Dynamics)
   **Core**: Neural networks self-organize to critical point σ→1, exhibiting spike avalanches and 1/f power laws.
   **Representatives**: Beggs & Plenz (2003); Shew & Plenz (2013).
   **Strengths**: Direct detection of critical indicators using spikes, EEG, MEG; corresponds to information transmission efficiency.
   **Limitations**: Is criticality necessary and sufficient? Clinical deep sleep also shows SOC traces.

3. **Geometric Topology & Integrated Information** (Geometric & Topological Metrics)
   **Core**: Uses invariants like Euler χ, Betti₁, Ricci curvature, Φ to measure "integration-differentiation balance".
   **Representatives**: IIT 3.0 (Tononi, 2014); topological data analysis in MEG (Giusti, 2015).
   **Strengths**: Cross-scale dimensionless; captures complex network reconstruction moments.
   **Limitations**: High computational cost, sensitive to data resolution; in-field Φ estimation remains limited.

4. **Energy-Metabolism & Information Efficiency** (Energetics & Efficiency)
   **Core**: Consciousness states correspond to maximal "information/power" efficiency η or energy consumption thresholds.
   **Representatives**: Attwell & Laughlin (2001); Stender et al. (2016, PET-CMRglc).
   **Strengths**: Direct connection with PET/fMRI metabolic imaging and clinical coma indicators.
   **Limitations**: Precise alignment between macroscopic energy consumption and microscopic information flow remains to be established.

## 💡 Chapter Summary

**Consciousness research stands at the convergence of technological, clinical, and social driving forces**; we attempt to propose a verifiable, collapsible, open-source unified indicator set. **The six keys and CTM extension** provide a single quantification window through distance measure $D_w$, laying the theoretical, empirical, and open-source verification foundation for subsequent chapters.
