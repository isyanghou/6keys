#### Causal Mapping

When information-power efficiency $Î·_{\text{eff}}(t)$ exceeds the critical threshold $Î·_c = 0.35$ and maintains this level for $\tau_c \approx 200\,\mathrm{ms}$, **$C_{\text{TEB}} = 1$**. Definition:

$$
\zeta_2 = \frac{Î·_{\text{eff}} - Î·_c}{\varepsilon_2}
$$

Efficiency decline (such as during sleep or high-magnesium anesthesia) leads to $Î·_{\text{eff}} \approx 0.28$, corresponding to **$\zeta_2 \approx -0.2$**, which is incorporated through weighting $w_2$ into:

$$
D_{w}^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i\,\zeta_{i}^{2}
$$

Tschantz 2023 simulations demonstrate that active inference networks switch to "energy-saving mode" when $Î·_{\text{eff}}$ falls below 0.3, a state consistent with the six-key model's prediction of low consciousnessâ€“high $D_w^2$ states.

##### Key Formula

$$
C_{\text{TEB}} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } Î·_{\text{eff}}(t) \ge Î·_c \text{ for } \tau_c \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
