## Research Motivation and Abstract

"If consciousness can be viewed as a critical phenomenon, it should simultaneously leave quantifiable critical fingerprints at statistical, geometric, energetic, and cellular levels; the six keys are cross-scale quantification channels for finding and aligning these fingerprints."

Over the past two decades, consciousness research has formed four major theoretical pillars: "free energy minimization, critical synchronization, geometric topology, and energy efficiency." However, critical indicators predominantly originate from "electrophysiological statistics" and are rarely integrated with energy metabolism, astrocytic dynamics, or topological geometric measures. This leads to parallel evidence across different scales lacking cross-validation. This study re-examines coupling mechanisms across scales, aiming to advance "common variables" for mutual verification or complementation. Free energy minimization, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and energy efficiency perspectives each employ independent mathematical languages. Therefore, we propose an integrated framework that is cross-scale, quantifiable, and amenable to open-source verification.

Based on the "critical brain" perspective, we propose six mutually interlocking critical conditions:

"**Six-Key Criticality**" ‚îÄ‚îÄ

1. **Free-Energy Limit Cycle** (FELC)
2. **Ricci-Flow Index** (RFI)
3. **Effective-Causal Gradient Percolation** (ECGP)
4. **Phase-Winding Circulation** (PWC)
5. **Astro-Cortical Interaction** (ACI)
6. **Thermo-Energetic Balance** (TEB)

The six keys collectively constitute a six-dimensional critical phase diagram. When they simultaneously approach the critical tube œÄ(Œ£_CT), we hypothesize this may provide one of the necessary conditions for reportable human consciousness. The selection principles for the six keys are:
(1) Critical complementarity ‚îÄ‚îÄ Each key targets a specific class of critical phenomena (statistical, geometric, energetic, cellular coupling), forming a six-dimensional critical phase space when combined.  
(2) Computability and openness ‚îÄ‚îÄ All indicators provide open algorithms for reproduction; initial exploration possible with open-source signals or small-scale simulations.  
(3) Minimal shared set ‚îÄ‚îÄ Selection of "common parameters" that span four major theoretical clusters to facilitate cross-comparison and coupling analysis.

### Theoretical Innovation

Theoretically, this study extends the original single-point critical hypersurface Œ£_c to a 'Critical Tube Manifold' (CTM) and defines a weighted distance:

$$D_w = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \zeta_i^2}, \quad \sum_i w_i = 1$$

as a single quantification metric, where $\zeta_i$ represents the dimensionless distance measures of the six keys.

### Evaluation and Open Source

Through conceptual-level Python simulations and reanalysis of three public EEG/MEG datasets (**wakefulness, deep sleep, propofol anesthesia**), the evaluation framework is:

- ‚úÖ **Wakeful state**: $D_w$ maintains within threshold $\theta_c$ for extended periods
- ‚ùå **Deep sleep and anesthetic states**: Most time segments show $D_w$ exceeding $\theta_c$

Such results would support the **multi-indicator co-criticality hypothesis**.
