## Problem Positioning: Why Do We Need a "Gray Zone" Level?

1. **Binary Division Insufficient**  
   - Traditional consciousness research often divides states into "awake vs unconscious".  
   - Behavioral and neural data show: skilled driving, pain withdrawal, subconscious emotions and other phenomena are neither pure reflexes nor reach reportable thresholds.

2. **Can Six Keys Capture This?**  
   - We propose:  
     $$\theta_1 < D_w(t) < \theta_2 \quad (\theta_1 \approx 0.5,\; \theta_2 \approx 1.0)$$  
     as the "shallow consciousness/automatic response gray zone".  
   - This segment allows partial key activation without requiring full integration.

## Level Comparison and Six-Key Activation Patterns

## System Level and $D_w$ Correlation Table

| System Level | Behavioral Examples | Typical Six-Key Positions | $D_w$ Range |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Organ/Reflex | Breathing rhythm, knee reflex | Almost all $\zeta_i \approx 0$ | $D_w \gtrsim \theta_2$ |
| **Gray Zone: Shallow Consciousness/Automatic Response** | Habitual driving turns, rapid facial emotion assessment | $\sigma \uparrow,\; \beta_1 \uparrow$; $\Phi, P, g_{\text{eff}}$ still low | $\theta_1 < D_w < \theta_2$ |
| Reportable Consciousness | Linguistic narrative, self-reflection | Most six keys near baseline; $D_w \le \theta_1$ | $D_w \le \theta_1$ |

## CTM Dynamics Perspective

### Tangential/Normal Eigenvalues

- Entering CTM tubule: $\lambda_{\perp} < 0$ (normal contraction)  
- Not yet stabilized at core: $\lambda_{\parallel} \gtrsim 0$ (tangential still drifting)

### Gray Zone Dynamic Equation

$$
\dot{\Psi} = J_{\text{CTM}}\Psi + G(u,t) + \eta(t),
\qquad
\Psi(t)\in \Sigma_{c}^{\theta_2} \setminus \Sigma_{c}^{\theta_1}
$$

- $\Psi$ first gains amplification in $\sigma,\,\beta_1$ axes, corresponding to local critical avalanches and circulation.  
- When $\Phi,P$ subsequently rise, the state converges toward $\Sigma_{c}^{\theta_1}$ forming reportable consciousness.

## Experimental Design and Validation Pathways

### Task Paradigms

1. **Automatic→Linguistic Switching**  
   - Continuous typing or driving simulation ➜ Random prompt "verbally describe next action".  
2. **Emotional Masking**  
   - 30 ms face + masking, require post-report emotion.

### Multimodal Recording

- EEG (1 kHz), fMRI (TR = 800 ms) synchronization  
- Behavioral timestamps and voice

### Data Pipeline (continued on next page)

```python
# Notebook: G_grayband_analysis.ipynb
zeta  = make_zeta(df_raw, eps)      # Convert to six-key standard components
df['Dw'] = np.sqrt((w * zeta**2).sum(axis=1))

# Annotate gray zone
df['state'] = np.select(
    [df.Dw <= theta1, df.Dw < theta2],
    ['conscious', 'grayband'],
    default='reflex')
```

### Validation Indicators

- Gray zone dwell time vs. behavioral delay: Spearman ρ  
- $\sigma,\,\beta_1$ early elevation time → Granger causality test  
- tACS β-band stimulation post gray zone window changes: paired t-test

## Philosophical Mapping

| Philosophical Framework | Corresponding Six-Key Gray Zone Interpretation |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Merleau-Ponty Body Schema | β₁ circulation = "Silent bodily intentionality" |
| Damasio Core Self | Gray zone state, emotion and sensation but no linguistic report yet |
| IIT Low Φ Systems | $\Phi$ low but not zero; belongs to "sub-threshold consciousness" |

## Summary

1. **Gray Zone Existence** provides the six-key framework with "continuous state" rather than binary experimental handles.  
2. **σ, β₁ as Sentinel Keys** activate first significantly, consistent with local criticality and topological synchronization needs for rapid response.  
3. **$D_w$ Dual Thresholds** $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ help us quantify reflexes, gray zone, and reportable consciousness in an integrated manner.  
4. **Verifiable Methods**: Task switching, stimulation intervention, and multimodal recording can all directly test the "gray zone hypothesis".  

> Through this appendix, we demonstrate how the six-key framework translates "shallow consciousness/automatic response"—a gray area long debated in philosophy and phenomenology—into observable, controllable, and quantifiable critical windows.
