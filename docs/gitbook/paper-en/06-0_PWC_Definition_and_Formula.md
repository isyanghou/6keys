###### Figure 06-0.1 PWC â€“ Phase Topological Circulation (Î¶â‚…)
#### Causal Mapping

When topological charge $Î²_{1}(t)$ stably maintains the same sign and forms closed circulation â†’ **$C_{\text{PWC}} = 1$**. Definition:
$$
\zeta_5 = \frac{Î²_{1} - Î²_{1}^{*}}{\varepsilon_5}, \qquad Î²_{1}^{*} = 0
$$
Whole-brain MEG-measured spiral waves ("rotating phase") increase, causing $Î²_{1} \uparrow$ â†’ **$\zeta_5 \uparrow$**, then added with $w_5 = 0.12$:
$$
D_{w}^{2} = w_{1}\,\zeta_{1}^{2} + w_{3}\,\zeta_{3}^{2} + w_{4}\,\zeta_{4}^{2} + w_{5}\,\zeta_{5}^{2} + \dots
$$
Schartner 2024 shows that under general anesthesia, topological circulation density is halved, corresponding to $\zeta_5 \approx -0.25$, and positively correlates with consciousness scores (*r* = 0.58).
