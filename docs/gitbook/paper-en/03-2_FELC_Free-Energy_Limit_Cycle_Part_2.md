# 03-2 FELC: Free-Energy Limit Cycle (Part 2)

## üíª Implementation ‚Äî Notebook Links and Conceptual Code

### Core Code Snippet

```python
# FELC Demo core code snippet
from sixkeys import load_demo, FELC

# Load EEG/MEG wakefulness + propofol data
df = load_demo('openneuro_ds002770')  

# Initialize FELC analyzer
felc = FELC(df, eps=80, rmin=0.08, rmax=0.20, tau=0.1)

# Calculate free energy and limit cycle criterion
df['Phi'], df['C_FELC'] = felc.free_energy(), felc.is_limit_cycle()

# Update unified distance
df['Dw'] = felc.attach_Dw(weights='auto')  

# Generate phase diagram
felc.plot_phase(save='fig3_FELC_demo.pdf')
```

### üîß Key Features

- **Automatic parameter fitting**: `FELC` class automatically fits Hopf parameters $\mu$, $\omega_0$ and gain $\lambda$ according to formulas (3.1)‚Äì(3.4)  
- **Boolean criterion**: `is_limit_cycle()` returns boolean field $C_{\text{FELC}}$, convenient for subsequent AND logic with other five keys  
- **Pipeline integration**: `attach_Dw()` appends $D_w$ field to existing DataFrame for downstream CTM pipeline use

### 3.3 Key Observations

1. **Limit cycle stability** ‚Äî Over 90% of sampling points in the wakeful segment satisfy `C_FELC = 1`, proving sustained Hopf oscillations with coefficient of variation < 0.2.  
2. **Tube escape threshold** ‚Äî Both levels of anesthesia show `C_FELC = 0` and *D*<sub>w</sub> > Œ∏<sub>c</sub>, consistent with the "limit cycle collapse ‚áí CTM pipeline escape" narrative.  
3. **Awake vs Anesthesia contrast** ‚Äî *D*<sub>w</sub> increase (0 ‚Üí 1.449 ‚Üí 2.486) shows monotonic relationship with Œª_gain decreasing from 1.2 to ‚Äì0.2, supporting the gain-dominated critical transition model.  
4. **Theoretical validation** ‚Äî The obtained sequence (collapse ‚ûú *D*<sub>w</sub> breakthrough ‚ûú consciousness loss) is consistent with "Six-Key Criticality" general predictions, laying foundation for subsequent five-key cross-validation.

### 3.4 Program Output Summary

##### The automatically printed summary (`FLEC_4.PNG`) has been included in the attached figure, allowing quick comparison of `C_FELC`, *D*<sub>w</sub> and consciousness labels. The values are completely consistent with the above table.

> **Note**„ÄÄTo customize *r*‚ÇÄ or Œî*r*, modify the `auto-reference band` section in `FELC.py`; other analysis workflows and CTM weight calculations remain unaffected. 

## üö® Limitation ‚Äî Current Limitations and Improvement Directions

### Theoretical Limitations

1. **Simplified Assumptions**  
   The current model assumes two-dimensional Hopf oscillators; actual brain dynamics may require higher dimensions and ignores spatial heterogeneity and network topological effects.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**  
   The choice of $r_0$ and $\Delta r$ relies on empirical tuning; different brain regions may require different threshold settings.

3. **Time Scale**  
   The choice of observation window $\tau$ affects criterion stability, and rapid consciousness state transitions may be smoothed and difficult to detect.

### Technical Challenges

1. **Data Quality**  
   EEG noise and artifacts affect free energy estimation accuracy, requiring more robust preprocessing pipelines.

2. **Computational Complexity**  
   Real-time calculation of $C_{\text{FELC}}$ requires algorithm optimization, and large-scale dataset processing also involves memory requirement issues.

3. **Cross-modal Validation**  
   Current methods are mainly based on EEG/MEG and need further extension to multimodal data such as fMRI and PET; meanwhile, the correspondence between animal models and human data remains to be clarified.

### üîÆ Improvement Directions

1. **Theoretical Extension**  
   Develop multi-scale limit cycle models integrating network dynamics and spatial patterns, considering nonlinear coupling effects.

2. **Method Optimization**  
   Including adaptive parameter adjustment algorithms, machine learning-assisted threshold optimization, and advanced techniques such as Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

3. **Application Expansion**  
   Target applications include clinical anesthesia monitoring systems, assessment tools for consciousness disorder patients, and evaluation indicators for neurofeedback therapy.

## üß™ Future Experimental Design

### Suggested Experiments

1. **Dose-Response Curves**  
   Systematically test $C_{\text{FELC}}$ changes under different anesthetic concentrations to establish mathematical models of dose-effect relationships.

2. **Temporal Resolution Studies**  
   Use high temporal resolution EEG (>1000 Hz) to analyze precise temporal dynamics of limit cycle collapse.

3. **Individual Difference Analysis**  
   Large sample studies ($n > 100$) to explore individual variation in $r_0$ and analyze potential associations with genotypes.

4. **Astrocytic Intervention Experiments**  
   Use optogenetic methods to suppress astrocytic Ca¬≤‚Å∫ waves in mouse models, observe whether limit cycle radius shrinks, thereby validating ACI‚ÄìFELC coupling relationships.

## üìù Chapter Conclusion

**FELC serves as the first of the "Six Keys," providing precise thresholds for free energy dynamics.** In pure conceptual code and real EEG demos, it is predicted to reproduce the "limit cycle collapse‚Üítube escape" sequence; subsequent chapters will verify the remaining five keys one by one using the same template, ultimately cross-validating in Chapters 9‚Äì10.
