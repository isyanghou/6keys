# 06-2 PWC: Phase Topological Circulation Œ≤‚ÇÅ (Part 2)

## üíª Implementation ‚Äî Notebook and Conceptual Code

### Core Code Snippets

```python
# PWC Demo core program
from sixkeys import load_demo, PWC

# Load MEG data, 306 channels, 1 kHz sampling
df = load_demo('openneuro_ds002345')            

# Initialize PWC analyzer
pwc = PWC(df, embed_win=0.1, vr_eps=0.4,
          beta1_lo=2, beta1_hi=6, tau_c=0.1)

# Compute first Betti number and PWC criterion
df['beta1'], df['C_PWC'] = pwc.betti1(), pwc.is_circulating()

# Update weighted distance
df['Dw'] = pwc.attach_Dw(weights='auto')        

# Generate topological analysis plots
pwc.plot_betti(save='fig6_PWC_demo.pdf')
```

### üîß Module Highlights

- **Efficient Computation**: `PWC` module uses CUDA version Ripser to compute persistent homology, processing 10 s MEG segments requires only about 6.8 s GPU time.  
- **Logic Integration**: `is_circulating()` outputs $C_{\text{PWC}}$ according to formula (6.1), can be directly multiplied and integrated with boolean fields from FELC, RFI, ECGP.  
- **Frequency Flexibility**: Can specify `band=('theta','gamma')` during initialization, automatically reconstructs phases and estimates $Œ≤_1$.

### 6.2 Quantitative Results

| State | `C_PWC` | *D*<sub>w</sub> | Consciousness Assessment |
|-------|:-------:|---------------:|:--------:|
| Awake            | **1** | **0.008** | ‚úÖ Conscious |
| Light-Sedation   | 0     | 0.779 | ‚ùå Non-conscious |
| Deep-Anesthesia  | 0     | 1.554 | ‚ùå Non-conscious |
> **Critical Œ≤-band**: Œ≤<sub>min</sub> = 0.80, Œ≤<sub>max</sub> = 1.20; observation window œÑ = 10 s; in-band criterion = 90 % 

---
### 6.3 Key Observations  

1. **Circulation Stability** ‚Äî In the awake segment, >90% of samples within the recent œÑ = 10 s fall within the critical band, hence `C_PWC = 1`. 
2. **Loop collapse ‚Üí D_w** ‚Äî Both anesthesia levels show `C_PWC = 0` and *D*<sub>w</sub> > Œ∏<sub>c</sub>, confirming "topological circulation collapse ‚áí pipeline distance increase ‚áí consciousness loss".
3. **Awake vs Anesthesia** ‚Äî *D*<sub>w</sub> increases monotonically with |Œ∂‚ÇÑ| (0.008 ‚Üí 0.779 ‚Üí 1.554), consistent with weight *w‚ÇÑ* = 0.15 prediction.
4. **Cross-Key Consistency** ‚Äî PWC collapse timing echoes FELC, RFI, ECGP, supporting the "critical stratified collapse" multi-key model.

## üö® Reflection ‚Äî Limitations and Future Pathways

### Current Limitations

1. **Computational Cost**  
   High-dimensional phase VR complexes still require over 3 minutes processing time per segment on fMRI with more than 400 channels; considering developing sparse approximation or Alpha complex alternatives.

2. **Frequency Band Dependence**  
   $Œ≤_1$ is quite sensitive to selected frequency bands; Gamma-only embedding often leads to inflated $Œ≤_1 > 10$ phenomena.

3. **Embedding Window Width ($\Delta t$)**  
   If time window is too narrow, circulation will be missed; if too wide, signals will be averaged; adaptive window length adjustment is not yet implemented.

### üîÆ Verifiable Experiments

1. **Closed-Loop tACS Circulation Maintenance**  
   Combine $\theta$‚Äì$\gamma$ cross-frequency stimulation, monitor $Œ≤_1$ in real-time and dynamically adjust amplitude to maintain $C_{\text{PWC}} = 1$, can be used to compare subjective continuity reports.

2. **Laminar MEG**  
   Use high-resolution MEG with laminar modeling to verify whether circulation paths travel along cortical sulcal spatial directions.

3. **Sleep Transition Studies**  
   Monitor the sequence of $Œ≤_1$ collapse and K-complex appearance during N2 ‚Üí N3 process to test the "topological collapse ‚Üí slow wave" hypothesis.

### üöÄ Technical Improvement Directions

1. **Algorithm Optimization**  
   Develop landmark-based sparse TDA, implement incremental persistent homology computation, and parallelize VR complex construction process with GPU.

2. **Theoretical Extension**  
   Explore multi-scale topological analysis ($Œ≤_0$, $Œ≤_1$, $Œ≤_2$), establish dynamical models for time-varying topology, and integrate graph theory with topological indicators to enhance analytical capabilities.

3. **Clinical Applications**  
   Establish real-time topological monitoring systems, individualized $Œ≤_1$ baseline models, and integrate with multi-modal neuroimaging to promote clinical translation.

## üß™ Future Experimental Design

### Suggested Experimental Protocols

1. **High-Density EEG Topological Mapping**  
   Use 256-channel EEG to compare topological patterns between awake and anesthetized states, analyze contribution distribution of $Œ≤_1$ across brain regions.

2. **Drug Comparison Studies**  
   Systematically analyze effects of different anesthetics on topological circulation, establish quantitative drug‚Äìtopology‚Äìconsciousness models.

3. **Developmental Studies**  
   Compare differences in topological circulation between children, adults, and elderly, explore age-related topological evolution.

4. **Pathological State Studies**  
   Analyze topological structural characteristics in epilepsy, coma, vegetative state patients, and develop topology-based consciousness assessment tools.

## üìù Chapter Conclusion

**PWC serves as the fourth pillar of the six keys, introducing phase topological circulation into the topological layer of CTM distance $D_w$.** Four keys simultaneously validate the "pipeline collapse ladder" hypothesis; the next chapter (Chapter 7) will explore neuron‚Äìastrocyte coupling criticality $g_{\text{eff}}$ (ACI), completing the final piece of the six-key system puzzle.
