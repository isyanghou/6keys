## Appendix E｜Transparency & Open Science Statement

### E.0 Disclaimer
This paper is a theoretical model constructed by the author through interdisciplinary exploration in collaboration with AI, and does not claim any clinical, experimental, or biological factual basis. The experimental planning and collaboration platforms mentioned in the paper are all suggested reference blueprints and do not represent real institutional plans or research projects. Their actual value and practical potential depend on free evaluation by the professional community.

### E.1 Ethics Statement
This research **does not involve** any human or animal experiments, nor does it analyze any non-public personal data. All results come from: (i) published literature data, and (ii) simulation outputs from publicly available neural simulation software toolkits. Therefore, no Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is required.

### E.2 Competing Interests Statement
The author declares: **no financial or non-financial conflicts of interest**.

### E.3 Funding Statement
This research **received no external funding support**. All computations and simulations were performed by the author using personal workstations.

### E.4 Data Availability
This research **did not establish new empirical datasets**. All numerical parameters taken from literature are completely listed in the text. Related simulation results can be reproduced according to the open-source code repository below.

### E.5 Code Availability

### E.7 AI-Assisted Writing Disclosure

Parts of this paper's draft content (including structural outlines, mathematical derivations, code prototypes, and language refinement) were generated with assistance from multiple large language models, primarily using ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT‑4o, o3), supplemented by Claude 4 Sonnet (Anthropic), Grok (xAI), Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google), and DeepSeek‑R1 to explore alternative perspectives and technical approaches. We hereby express our gratitude.

### E.9 Acknowledgements

This research acknowledges the contributions of numerous open-source scientific tools and communities, particularly technical resources such as Mermaid, Matplotlib, NetworkX, PyTorch, and Jupyter, as well as Open Source Neuroscience Communities—including OpenNeuro, NeuroStars, and Neuromatch Academy, whose public documentation and discussion content provided important inspiration for the design of this model.

We also acknowledge ChatGPT (OpenAI o3) for the structural, programming, and linguistic assistance provided during the draft construction process. The completion of this research is the result of years of accumulated contributions by many unnamed contributors, to whom we express our sincere respect.
